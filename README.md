## Motivation

> **"Ship your product, not your perfection."** – Anonymous
>
> **"Done is better than perfect."** – Sheryl Sandberg
>
> **"Release early, release often."** – Eric S. Raymond

Remember: **features can always come later**. The most important step is to **get your product in front of users**, learn from real feedback, and iterate. Don’t wait for the “perfect version”—the perfect way to learn is by shipping.

**Tips for staying motivated:**  

- Start with an MVP (Minimum Viable Product).  
- Focus on solving one core problem really well.  
- Launch publicly, even if it’s rough.  
- Collect user feedback and improve in small increments.
